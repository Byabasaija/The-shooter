## Initial Objectives
At the beginning of this project, i wanted to give my giant shooter shooter ship the ability to release a massive weapon, like a bomb that can destroy many alien ships at a once.
At the end i didnot implement this because it required more tecnicality which would require me to do further reading yet i had less time.
