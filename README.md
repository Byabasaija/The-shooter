## Description

A certain planet has been invaded by aliens. The invasion has been detected and a giant shooter ship has been sent to space to shoot the alien ships down before they cross the space to reach the plannet. Alien ships can shoot down the player's shooter ship and also can explode with it. Shooter ship therefore has to avoid being hit by any alien ship and must make sure he shoots as many alien ships as possible.
