## Description

A certain planet has been invaded by aliens. The invasion has been detected and a giant shooter ship has been sent to space to shoot the alien ships down before they cross the space to reach the plannet. Alien lasers cannot destroy the shooter ship because it was designed specifically for the purpose. However, the shooter is given limited time in space therefore he must shoot very fast and must make sure he shoots as many alien ships as possible.

## Initial Objectives
At the beginning of this project, i wanted to give my giant shooter shooter ship the ability to release a massive weapon, like a bomb that can destroy many alien ships at a once.
At the end i didnot implement this because it required more tecnicality which would require me to do further reading and research yet i had less time.
